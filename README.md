A central vacuum unit comprises a cyclonic chamber having a sidewall. A motor causes a swirl of air loaded with debris to centrifugally contact an inner surface of the sidewall of the cyclonic chamber. A lateral outlet is defined through the sidewall to provide for lateral discharge of the debris from the cyclonic chamber.

Selecting a central vacuum system for your residence requires some time and a bit of research, because firstly, you need to understand what you are looking for.  There are advantages to central vacs and also some disadvantages to the systems and all issues should be considered pre-installation.  This is especially important because these systems are usually quite expensive to purchase and install. You will want to know that you are getting value for money and also that the system is going to meet the particular needs of your house. To describe a central vacuum system is to say that it is a small attachment that connects to an area of your walls. Than what you vacuum, (or hoover up), is sent through a series of internal pipes in your walls and collected in a convenient area for disposal. There are several things to consider with regard to a central vacuum system:  

The power of the system – This is known as the suction power or ‘waterlift’.  If the central vacuum is not strong enough for your home, then results will be poor.  

Size of your residence – Before you purchase any particular central vacuum system, you need to know the internal floor area of your residence.  The power of the system needs to be adequate to clean your house properly.

Guarantee / Warranty – As with any sizeable investment, you want a full warranty in the event of something malfunctioning with the system.  You would also like to purchase the system from a reputable supplier that is going to give you good after sales service.

System power – It is advisable to get the most powerful system within your price range, as this will ensure the best results from the system.

Extra Features – Different systems will have additional features and it will be up to you to decide which of these features may be of interest to you.  For example it would be a good idea to look for features such as a filter that improves the air quality of the residence. Also there is a company which produces a suction hose called hide-a-hose for example, which is a neat way of storing the hose. You might also consider installing a heat recovery ventilation system along with a central vacuum system – obviously installing such a system will cost more, but may well be a choice worth considering in order to increase the energy efficiency of your home.

Accessories – The best systems come with a large range of accessories, which will be of assistance to you in cleaning a large array of different surfaces easily.  Some systems will include these accessories in the purchase price and others will require you to purchase these separately.  It is important that you are at least able to purchase the accessories for the system at some point in the future, i.e. a system that does not manufacture these accessories may not be the best choice for you.

There are many central vacuum forums on the internet that may be of help to you  if you are considering purchasing a C.V.S.  Don’t be afraid to ask a question or leave a comment if it suits you to do so.
